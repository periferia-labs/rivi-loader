# rivi-loader

rivi-loader is a Vulkan-based program loader for GPGPU applications. It builds on the Rust-based Vulkan wrapper [ash](https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash). The project is a part of research agenda of interoperable GPU computing, that is, an effort to evaluate how Vulkan could be utilized to replace GLSL and CUDA accelerated programs with Vulkan.

The project aims to highlight performance optimizations available by using Vulkan with hand-written SPIR-V code. Various recent features of Vulkan, such as variable storage buffer pointers, dedicated memory allocations, subgroup operations, and asynchronous queue family usage are all relevant parts of the effort.

Thanks to Vulkan, the example programs run on both discrete and integrated graphics cards and across various operating systems. Testing on discrete cards has primarily been done on Windows 10 and Linux (Arch and Ubuntu LTS using proprietary drivers) using AMD and Nvidia cards, with both AMD and Intel CPUs on computers with single and multiple GPUs. Integrated cards that have been tested include Apple M1, Raspberry Pi 4, and Nvidia Jetson TX2.

The project is aimed as an example repository from which motivated people can use to start to tip their toes into GPGPU. In particular, the `examples/repl.rs` should be a good starting point to see what can be abstracted away. At the moment, programming your own application requires SPIR-V know-how, but one of the primary goals of the effort is eventually integrating a flavor of APL as the user-interfacing language (see: [haavisto2021vulkan](https://github.com/jhvst/haavisto2021vulkan) and [hal-03155647](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03155647/)).

## Features

- millisecond-scale cold-start times of GPGPU programs
- use of multiple queue families by subslicing output buffer into fragments
- per device program loading to target Kubernetes-based scheduling
- interoperable platform support across operating systems and graphics cards

## Limitations

- output buffer dimensions have to be statically known and oftentimes hand-written, no type inference is given at the moment
- work submission must be based on the factor of queue family counts: e.g. you can submit 10 items in parallel to most discrete cards since the queue family count is 2, but for integrated cards like Apple M1 the factor is 4 thus you would need to send either 8 or 12 items (though, the amount of queue family count is outputted in debug messages) -- uneven work submission in part of future work
- memory limitations are not endorsed, which means **you may run out of memory and hang your computer** if you submit too much work or even run the `rf` example
- **there are no safety guarantees, running any of the programs can hang your computer and require force restart -- save your work before running any of the examples!**

## Installation

Please read the warnings above, and decide whether to proceed.

1. Make sure Rust is installed, if not, consider [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Make sure Vulkan is installed, if not, consider [LunarG](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) and the installation instructions found on [ash](https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash#example)
3. Run an example. **Recommended**: simple vector addition `cargo run --release --example repl`. For random forest prediction (see: [haavisto2021vulkan](https://github.com/jhvst/haavisto2021vulkan)) run `cargo run --release --example rf` (**this may crash your computer**).

### Example descriptions

- `repl` a rough translation of WebGPU-based [laskin.live](https://github.com/periferia-labs/laskin.live) on Vulkan
- `rf` a random forest prediction algorithm translated from scikit (proof-of-concept of variable pointers feature and performance comparison against Cython)
